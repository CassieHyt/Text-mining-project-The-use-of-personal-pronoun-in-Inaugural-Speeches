### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: The use of personal pronoun in Inaugural Speeches
+ This project is conducted by Yitong Hu

+ Project summary: People always use a lot of personal pronouns to avoid repeating someone’s names time and time again. Different people may use different personal pronouns for different weight in different situation to demonstrate different meanings and emotions. What about the situations in presidents’ Inaugural Speeches? I analyze the general trend of presidents using personal pronouns and cluster the extreme users(top 10 using a certain personal pronoun separately at a high frequency) to find their features,then analyse based on each sentence to see the content and emotion it conveys.

+ Please note,I have not editted the other parts of project files since the due date of the project,only editted this readme file which I forget to update.
